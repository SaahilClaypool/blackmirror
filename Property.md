# Intellectual Property

This episode does not directly address intellectual property issues, but we can predict some of the consequences
were everyone to have this always-on recording implant. In the past, the publishing industry^1 has traditionally
objected to any advance in technology that could possibly make copying easier, one of the most recent and
relevant cases being *Sony Corp. of America v. Universal Studios* (1984) (abbreviated as *Sony v. Universal*).

## *Sony v. Universal*

*Sony v. Universal* stemmed from the development of the first videotaping devices and a precursor to
VHS tapes, called Betamax. The system Sony developed allowed consumers to record television broadcasts to a
magnetic tape, which they could play back at their leisure or even keep for long periods of time. Universal
Studios and the Walt Disney Corporation objected to this, worried that consumers could use the device to
record copies of their products and possibly share them -- cutting into their profits. They sued Sony for
enabling copyright infringement, 

Ultimately, the Supreme Court ruled against Univesral, arguing that recording television shows for the
purpose of "time shifting" (recording and watching later, ex. if the original broadcast happened at an
inconvenient time) is not copyright infringement, but instead fair use. Furthermore, Universal had failed to
prove actual harm, and in one case a noted television personality (Mr. Rogers) testified as being in favor of
allowing timeshifting. Ironically, Universal and Disney went on to earn a great deal of profit from the sales
of tapes of their shows.

## *? v. Grain*

A nearly identical argument could be made against grain memory -- why buy a copy of the movie when you could
just watch a re-do of the time you saw it in theaters, or watch a copy from a friend? Why pay for a subscription
to something like Spotify when you could just queue up audio-only re-dos of times you've listened to songs
before?

These scenarios could all have a large impact on the recording industry, as grains are much more powerful
than VHS. However, the episode shows no evidence that grain memories are directly transferable (as if they
were files), so any time you watch someone else's re-do, you could expect a decrease in quality. You could
also expect a decrease in quality in watching your own re-dos of movies -- imagine watching a movie where
every so often the camera darts away from the screen so the camera person can scratch an itch, or have a sip
of water.

For quality reasons, it's doubtful that any sort of grain-based piracy would seriously catch on (for
a modern reference, "cammed" movies where someone physically records a theatrical release, are nowhere near
as popular as DVD rips and other direct sources^2), but regardless it's likely that the publishing industry
would fight back.
