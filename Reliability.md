# Software Reliability

Given the extent to which technology is integrated into people's lives in Black Mirror, having it work reliably is of great importance. The grain in particular would be a huge danger to people's safety if there was a flaw in its software. As it is connected to the brain and can access a person's memories, if it were to malfunction, it would likely cause physical harm. In the worst imaginable scenario, it could send signals to the brain that inhibit the person's ability to function, killing them, or handicapping them for life. Since the grain is also used to store memories, it is possible that software glitches could cause it to erase certain memories, or create memories of things that never happened.

In our world, software is never without bugs, which raises the question of how safe the grain could possibly be. It seems impossible that the company producing it could ever test it thoroughly enough to catch every flaw. It would be very interesting to see what would happen if a software issue in the grain was exposed and did cause someone harm. It is unknown whether the company that produced it would be held liable, or if the grain is a technology that consumers use at their own risk. Even if the company was held liable, the grain is so integrated into society that it is hard to predict what the consumer backlash would be. Some people would probably be outraged, but others would probably stubbornly believe it could never happen to them.
