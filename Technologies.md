# Technologies

## Running List

- The 'Grain'

    Some sort of technology that stores and replays every memory a person has. This also seems to include some metal device that allows the scrolling and replay of memories on any computer device. 

- Contact payments 

    See when Liam Foxwell (the main character) uses his "fob" to pay the taxi

- Heads up displays through contacts

    Used the entire movie to replay memories


- Lip Reading from a video

    Used when Liam is attempting to see what his wife said to Jonas

- Screen casting

    The characters use their 'fob' to display what they are seeing onto a screen. This is like a much better version of miracast devices.

- Ads on public transport
  
    As soon as Liam Foxwell enters a cab, the cab starts playing advertisements for a grain

- TSA / Airlines use personal memories for security 
  
    The airlines seems to use the last week of memories to check that Liam is not nefarious before he boards the airplane.
